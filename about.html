                <span> Fun Fact #1 </span>
                <h3> Bookworm </h3>
                <p> Others would undoubtedly argue that reading is boring, time-consuming, and money-sucking. I will not argue with them on their stance, but for us bookworms, reading is not money-sucking, not boring, but rather very very fun.  According to a popular saying, while a person who doesn't read may live a full life, a person who reads may live countless lives. For us bookworms reading is an escape into new worlds, new lives, and places where we can live through various scenarios safely or simply a coping mechanism to escape reality. </p>

                <span> Fun Fact #2 </span>
                <h3> INTJ Personality </h3>
                <p> An alien in a crazy world. Feelings of a robot, but a desire to understand humans. Smarter than the average bear, and while we're at it, harder working, more efficient, better planners, and more ambitious. Acting to gain control of life's deep and sometimes uncontrollable emotions. At times, oblivious to the rest of the world. Being an INTJ isn't all it's cracked up to be, but if you can deal with its drawbacks, it's fantastic. The most important lesson that an INTJ can learn is that "INTJs are not superior; we are simply different." </p>

                <span> Fun Fact #3 </span>
                <h3> Ambivert</h3>
                <p> The stereotype is that all bookworms are introverts, which, like all stereotypes is untrue. Yes, many readers are introverts, but people often forget that all readers are human, and humans come in an infinite variety. As for me, I am an Ambivert; we are those who are both extroverts and introverts. It's both good and bad, but most of the time it's confusing. You enjoy being alone while also wanting to socialize but lack the energy to do so; you feel lonely (hates being alone) at times and solitude (loves being alone) at others. The best thing about being an Ambivert is that you understand both personality types and can easily socialize with people of both types. </p>

                <span> Fun Fact #4 </span>
                <h3> Cancer Zodiac </h3>
                <p> The zodiac sign Cancer is a water sign. Cancer's ability to exist in both emotional and material realms is symbolized by the crab, an oceanic crustacean that moves between the sea and the shore with ease. Cancers have heightened intuitive abilities, and they can easily sense the energy in a room because of their psychic prowess. These crabs are incredibly sensitive to their surroundings and fiercely protective of themselves. Cancers have tough, external shells that protect them, much like their celestial spirit animal. These crabs may at first appear to be cold or distant. But over time, Cancers show their gentleness, sincere compassion, and mystical skills.</p>
